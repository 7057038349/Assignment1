						<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. ... Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists.
Apple trees need at least 8 hours of sun per day during the growing season. Two varieties are required for successful pollination; one can be a crabapple. Dwarf apple trees will start bearing fruit 2 to 3 years after planting. Standard size trees can take up to 8 years to bear fruit.
Apples trees aren’t just for people with acres upon acres of land. Even in a small space, you can plant a hedge of dwarf apple trees or an apple espalier and yield a successful crop.
